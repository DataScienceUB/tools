<summary><b>Question</b>: Which of the following model's predictions have been affected by selection bias?

<ul>
  <li>Engineers built a model to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on their daily food intake. The model was trained on 10,000 "food diaries" collected from a randomly chosen group of people worldwide representing a variety of different age groups, ethnic backgrounds, and genders. However, when the model was deployed, it had very poor accuracy. Engineers subsequently discovered that food diary participants were reluctant to admit the true volume of unhealthy foods they ate, and were more likely to document consumption of nutritious food than less healthy snacks.</li>

</summary>
There is no selection bias in this model; participants who provided training data were a representative sampling of users and were chosen randomly. Instead, this model was affected by reporting bias. Ingestion of unhealthy foods was reported at a much lower frequency than true real-world occurrence.

# Tema 1


This is example page of the API doc style created
[Aras Pranckevičius](https://github.com/aras-p) at Unity for Morgan McGuire's
[Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) and now part of the official Markdeep distro.
It uses content that could be an imaginary documentation page. Here would be some introduction
text.

## Recursió quan les coses no van bé.


La **recursió** $f(x)^2 = u$  consisteix en què un programa es crida a si mateix. Un programa recursiu ben fet ha de complir 2
condicions:

+ ha d'haver-hi un o més casos base: són condicions de les dades que es resolen directament, sense que calgui una nova crida al programa

+ a cada crida recursiva ens apropem a un dels casos base: ja sigui perquè es decrementa una variable, perquè es redueix una llista...

D'una manera simplificada podríem dir que els algorismes recursius segueixen el patró:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

def recursiu(x):
	if x=cas_final:
		return VALOR
	else:
		return CRIDA_RECURSIVA(x reduïda)+Calculs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! Error: Compte amb la recusió.
    No feu mai més de 100 crides recursives d'un programa!

    $$f(x) = 23$$



## Invoking it

<div class="admonition note">
This is a note by the way!
</div>

From the root folder, run "thing" with the target name, e.g.: `thing Yes`

* On Mac, Linux or Windows PowerShell, you'll want to use `./thing` instead of just `thing`.
* Target and option names are case sensitive!
* Several things to do can be specified: `thing Yes No FileNotFound`

Additional options can be passed via `-sNAME=VALUE` arguments. Most common ones are CONFIG
(used to indicate debug or release thing) and PLATFORM (used to indicate 32 vs 64 bit thing).


### Subsection on stuff


Thing Name              | Description        |Notes
------------------------|--------------------|-----
Yes                     | Yup!               |
No                      | Nope :(            |
FileNotFound            | Doesn't find files | Pass `-sFIND_FILE=maybe` to maybe find them


## Markdeep syntax test

Regular styling like **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`, the stuff.

* A
* Bullet
* List

And:

1. A
1. Numbered
1. List!

Symbol substitutions: a 45-degree turn; som x -> y arrows; some whoa ==> fancy <==> arrows.

Is this a definition list?
:   Looks like one to me
Is that right?
:   Possibly!

And a code listing:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Substitueix la comanda pass pel teu codi
def era1(n):
    import math
    pass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Markdeep diagrams:

*******************************************  Here's a text to the right of the diagram,
* +-----------------+           .-.       *  ain't that fancy. Pretty fancy indeed, I
* |\                |        .-+   |      *  must say! Markdeep diagrams are generally
* | \     A-B   *---+-   .--+       '--.  *  enclosed into a rectangle full made of `*`
* |  \              |   |     Cloud!    | *  symbols; and are "drawn" using ASCII-art
* +---+-------------+    '-------------'  *  style, with `- | + / \ * o` etc.
*******************************************  Suh-weet!


Another random diagram, just because:

********************
*    +-+-+-+-*-o   *
*   / / ^ /        *
*  / v / /         *
* +-+-+-+          *
********************

!!! Note
    Hey I'm a note. Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here.

!!! WARNING
    I'm a warning, perhaps. *Something might happen!*

And other admonitions:

!!! Error: Never Pass `nullptr` to a Shader
    Invoking a shader with a null argument can seg fault.
    This is a multi-line admonition.

    Seriously, don't call shaders like that.
